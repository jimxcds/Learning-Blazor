# Learning-Blazor
 Blazor page I created while learning Blazor

 In this app, I have:
 - A magic eight-ball program that randomly selects a string from a string array.
 - A calculator that can complete basic operations.
 - A button that can load and save a click amount from a database, with a notification system.
